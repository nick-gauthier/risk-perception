abstract = {Here we argue that, based on evolutionary, ecological and agronomic considerations, climate change could not have been a suitable background nor a probable cause of plant domestication in the Near East. This thesis is developed based on the year-to-year yield dynamics in traditional rainfed grain farming in semi-arid environments, on the genetic basis that underlies temporal yield dynamics in natural wild cereal populations as well as in traditional farming systems, and upon the recognition that prior to elaborate high capacity and long-range trade networks, yield stability was more important than yield maximization. We also briefly discuss the likely social and cultural responses to subtle and real climatic changes vs. responses to rapid directional environmental trends. Taking into account the agronomic, ecological and genetic aspects discussed, it is suggested that the Near Eastern founder crop assemblage was chosen to function within the normal east Mediterranean precipitation regime, in which good rainy years create the ‘normal surplus' that sustains farming communities during drought years, and the different crop types provide the system with its compensating ability. A slow (but real) climatic change is unlikely to induce major (revolutionary) cultural changes. Nor would a prominent environmental change provide the proper background for the origins of agriculture because it would abolish the buffering capacity of the system. Therefore, farming cannot function as a sustainable ‘buffering mechanism' to counterbalance climatic instability causing natural resource depletion.},

"Based on evolutionary, genetic and agronomic considerations, the major theme of this paper is that climatic change could not have been an adequate background for the emergence of grain farming in the Near East. The idea is developed through four stages: (1) Description of the agronomic basis of yield stability in traditional Near Eastern dryland farming systems; (2) Account of the genetic heterogeneity of traditional crop cultivars and of wild wheat populations; (3) Examination of the relationship between the erratic Near Eastern rainfall pattern and the adaptive advantage of genetic heterogeneity as a yield stabilizing agent; and (4) Examination of the Near Eastern Neolithic crops as an agronomic package designed to ensure yield stability rather than maximal yield." (p. 144)
"Here, we argue that if the Younger Dryas had been a significant change in the Near East climate or a minor one, and whatever the effect it had on the Levantine environment and biota, based on genetic and agronomic considerations it could not have been a probable cause of and/or a central factor in Near Eastern plant domestication."

abstract = {Wheat is one of the founder crops of Western agriculture. This study reconstructs agronomic conditions, potential yields, and kernel weight in the beginnings of cultivation of domesticated free-threshing wheat, c. 8000 BC. The carbon and nitrogen stable isotope compositions and the dimensions of fossil grains of naked wheat (Triticum aestivum/durum) were analysed. Samples were collected in Tell Halula and Akar{\c{c}}ay Tepe, two Neolithic archaeological sites from the Middle Euphrates (the claimed core area for wheat domestication). The samples analysed include the oldest reported remains of naked wheat. Consistently wetter conditions but lower kernel weights were found in the Neolithic compared with the present day. Besides, the estimated yields were clearly beyond what is expected from the gathering of wild stands of cereals. Patterns of phenotypic adaptation achieved by wheat after its diffusion through the Mediterranean were also assessed. On the one hand, the study looked at variation in morphophysiological traits as related to local climate in a set of 68 durum wheat landraces from the Middle Euphrates. On the other hand, an assessment was made of regional adaptation around the Mediterranean Basin in a set of 90 landraces, traditional varieties, and modern cultivars from different origins by characterizing agronomic and morphophysiological variability. Significant relationships were observed between phenotypic variation among landraces from the Middle Euphrates and both minimum temperatures and the ratio of precipitation to potential evapotranspiration of the sites of origin. In addition, consistent differences in grain yield, plant structure, and water status were found among genotypes following both north-south and east-west gradients across the Mediterranean. These differences are associated with contrasting environmental and selection pressures. {\textcopyright} The Author [2006].

The case study of Agave spp. bajada cultivation among the Classic Period, a.d. 1150–1450, Hohokam of southern Arizona illustrates how slight discounting of future rewards can significantly alter agriculture investment strategies. Despite a higher kcal/hour return than maize agriculture, agave cultivation lessened or ceased in several communities during a time in which intensification would be predicted due to inferred subsistence stress. We surmise the decade-long maturation of agave made it unattractive relative to more immediate return resources in any context that presented risks to land tenure. The cessation of agave cultivation can be understood on two levels of explanation. The long-term investments required by agave and tendency to discount future rewards are the ultimate causes. Political and social instability during the tumultuous Classic period, causing increased insecurity in land tenure, are the proximal causes.},

abstract = {The appearance of agriculture in the Fertile Crescent propelled the development of Western civilization. Here we investigate the evolution of agronomic conditions in this region by reconstructing cereal kernel weight and using stable carbon and nitrogen isotope signatures of kernels and charcoal from a set of 11 Upper Mesopotamia archaeological sites, with chronologies spanning from the onset of agriculture to the turn of the era. We show that water availability for crops, inferred from carbon isotope discrimination ($\delta$ 13 C), was two-to fourfold higher in the past than at present, with a maximum between 10,000 and 8,000 ‰cal BP. Nitrogen isotope composition ($\delta$ 15 N) decreased over time, which suggests cultivation occurring under gradually less-fertile soil conditions. Domesticated cereals showed a progressive increase in kernel weight over several millennia following domestication. Our results provide a first comprehensive view of agricultural evolution in the Near East inferred directly from archaeobotanical remains. {\textcopyright} 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

abstract = {Along with ceramics production, sedentism, and herding, agriculture is a major component of the Neolithic as it is defined in Europe. Therefore, the agricultural system of the first Neolithic societies and the dispersal of exogenous cultivated plants to Europe are the subject of many scientific studies. To work on these issues, archaeobotanists rely on residual plant remains—crop seeds, weeds, and wild plants—from archaeological structures like detritic pits, and, less often, storage contexts. To date, no plant with an economic value has been identified as domesticated in Western Europe except possibly opium poppy. The earliest seeds identified at archaeological sites dated to about 5500– 5200 BC in the Mediterranean and Temperate Europe. The cultivated plants identified were cereals (wheat and barley), oleaginous plant (flax), and pulses (peas, lentils, and chickpeas). This crop package originated in the Fertile Crescent, where it was clearly established around 7500 BC (final Pre-Pottery Neolithic B), after a long, polycentric domestication process. From the middle of the 7th millennium BC, via the Balkan Peninsula, the pioneer Neolithic populations, with their specific economies, rapidly dispersed from east to west, following two main pathways. One was the maritime route over the northwestern basin of the Mediterranean (6200–5300 BC), and the other was the terrestrial and fluvial route in central and northwestern continental Europe (5500–4900 BC). On their trajectory, the agropastoral societies adapted the Neolithic founder crops from the Middle East to new environmental conditions encountered in Western Europe. The Neolithic pioneers settled in an area that had experienced a long tradition of hunting and gathering. The Neolithization of Europe followed a colonization model. The Mesolithic groups, although exploiting plant resources such as hazelnut more or less intensively, did not significantly change the landscape. The impact of their settlements and their activities are hardly noticeable through palynology, for example. The control of the mode of reproduction of plants has certainly increased the prevalence of Homo sapiens, involving, among others, a demographic increase and the ability to settle down in areas that were not well adapted to year-round occupation up to that point. The characterization of past agricultural systems, such as crop plants, technical processes, and the impact of anthropogenic activities on the landscape, is essential for understanding the interrelation of human societies and the plant environment. This interrelation has undoubtedly changed deeply with the Neolithic Revolution.},

We use panarchy theory to frame an understanding of {\c{C}}atalh{\"{o}}y{\"{u}}k's long-term sustainability, arguing that its resilience was a function of three key factors: its diverse initial crop spectrum, which acted as an archive for later innovations; its modular social structure, enabling small-scale experimentation and innovation in cropping at the household level; and its agglomerated social morphology, allowing successful developments to be scaled up across the wider community. This case study in long-term sustainability through flexible, changeable cropping strategies is significant not only for understanding so-called boom and bust cycles elsewhere but also for informing wider agro-ecological understanding of sustainable development in central Anatolia and beyond.},

@article{Filippi2017,
abstract = {In this paper, we propose the modeling of a real-case problem where a farmer has to optimize the use of his/her land by selecting the best mix of crops to cultivate. Complexity of the problem is due to the several factors that have to be considered simultaneously. These include the market prices variability of harvested products, the specific resource requests for each crop, the restrictions caused by limited machines availability, and the timing of operations required to complete each crop cultivation. We provide two different mathematical formulations for the analyzed problem. The first one represents a natural integer programming formulation looking for the crop-mix that maximizes the farmer's expected profit measured as the difference between revenues obtained by selling the harvested products and the production costs. Since the revenue of each crop depends on the price as quoted at the exchange market and the yield per hectare of harvested product, we define it as a random variable. Then, the second model uses the maximization of the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) as objective function and looks for the crop-mix that allows to maximize the average expected profit under a predefined quantile of worst realizations. To test and compare the proposed models with the cultivation choice made by the farmer, we use Italian historical data represented by monthly returns of different crops over a time period of 16 years. Computational results emphasize the advantage of using the CVaR model for a risk-averse farmer and provide interesting insights for farmers involved in similar problems.},

@article{Bates2018,
abstract = {Several major cereal groups have been identified as staples used by the pre-urban, urban and post-urban phase populations of the Indus Civilisation (3200–1500 BCE): wheat, barley, a range of small hulled millets and also rice, though their proportional exploitation is variable across space and over time. Traditional quantification methods examine the frequency, intensity and proportionality of the use of these crops and help ascertain the ‘relative importance' of these cereals for Indus populations. However, this notion of ‘importance' is abstracted from the daily lives of the people using these crops and may be biased by the differential production (as well as archaeological survival) of individual cereals. This paper outlines an alternative approach to quantifying Indus cereals by investigating proportions of calories. Cereals are predominantly composed of carbohydrates and therefore provided much of the daily caloric intake among many late Holocene farming populations. The four major cereal groups cultivated by Indus farmers, however, vary greatly in terms of calories per grain, and this has an impact on their proportional input to past diets. This paper demonstrates that, when converted to proportions of calories, the perceived ‘importance' of cereals from five Indus sites changes dramatically, reducing the role of the previously dominant small hulled millet species and elevating the role of Triticoid grains. Although other factors will also have affected how a farmer perceived the role and importance of a crop, including its ecological tolerances, investments required to grow it, and the crop's role in the economy, this papers suggests that some consideration of what cereals meant in terms of daily lives is needed alongside the more abstracted quantification methods that have traditionally been applied.},

abstract = {Common research on decision-making investigates non-interdependent situations, i.e., "games against nature". However, humans are social beings and many decisions are made in social settings, where they mutually influence each other, i.e., "strategic games". Mathematical game theory gives a benchmark for rational decisions in such situations. The strategic character makes psychological decision-making more complex by introducing the outcomes for others as an additional attribute of that situation; it also broadens the field for potential coordination and cooperation problems. From an evolutionary point of view, behavior in strategic situations was at a competitive edge. This paper demonstrates that even in games against nature, people sometimes decide as if they were in a strategic game; it outlines theoretical and empirical consequences of such a shift of the frame. It examines whether some irrationalities of human decision-making might be explained by such a shift in grasping the situation. It concludes that the mixed strategies in games against nature demand a high expertise and can only be found in situations where these strategies improve the effects of minimax-strategies that are used in cases of risk-aversion.},

abstract = {This synthesis paper is intended to provide an overview of individual and collective decision-making processes that might serve as a theoretical foundation for a complexity-based approach to environmental policy design and natural resource management planning. Human activities are the primary drivers of change in the Earth's biosphere today, so efforts to shift the trajectory of social-ecological systems must focus on changes in individual and collective human behavior. Recent advances in understanding the biological basis of thought and memory offer insights of use in designing management and planning processes. The human brain has evolved ways of dealing with complexity and uncertainty, and is particularly attuned to social information. Changes in an individual's schemas, reflecting changes in the patterns of neural connections that are activated by particular stimuli, occur primarily through nonconsious processes in response to experiential learning during repeated exposure to novel situations, ideas, and relationships. Discourse is an important mechanism for schema modification, and thus for behavior change. Through discourse, groups of people construct a shared story - a collective model - that is useful for predicting likely outcomes of actions and events. In effect, good stories are models that filter and organize distributed knowledge about complex situations and relationships in ways that are readily absorbed by human cognitive processes. The importance of discourse supports the view that collaborative approaches are needed to effectively deal with environmental problems and natural resource management challenges. Methods derived from the field of mediation and dispute resolution can help us take advantage of the distinctly human ability to deal with complexity and uncertainty. This cognitive view of decision making supports fundamental elements of resilience management and adaptive co-management, including fostering social learning through the involvement of a broad range of stakeholders, and building trust and increasing links among governance organizations.

In this article, we combine experimental data on risk aversion with survey data to identify the extent to which risk aversion affects crop diversification decisions. We conduct experiments to measure the risk aversion of smallholder farmers in Burkina Faso and a field survey to gather data on various socio-economic variables. To measure crop diversification, we use three indices of spatial diversity in crop species adapted from the ecological economics literature, i.e., the count index, the Herfindahl index measure of crop concentration and the Shannon index of evenness. An Ordinary Least square (OLS) model is used to estimate the impact of risk aversion on crop diversification when the count index is used as the dependent variable, whereas a Tobit model is used for the Herfindahl index and the Shannon index. Our results show that risk aversion has a negative and significant effect on crop diversification. Although the effect is significant for all diversity indexes, the magnitude of the effect differs among them. Other variables also affect crop diversification. In particular, education level, distance to market, farm area and land fragmentation are associated with greater crop diversification. Key},

abstract = {Collective memory and attention are sustained by two channels: oral communication (communicative memory) and the physical recording of information (cultural memory). Here, we use data on the citation of academic articles and patents, and on the online attention received by songs, movies and biographies, to describe the temporal decay of the attention received by cultural products. We show that, once we isolate the temporal dimension of the decay, the attention received by cultural products decays following a universal biexponential function. We explain this universality by proposing a mathematical model based on communicative and cultural memory, which fits the data better than previously proposed log-normal and exponential models. Our results reveal that biographies remain in our communicative memory the longest (20–30 years) and music the shortest (about 5.6 years). These findings show that the average attention received by cultural products decays following a universal biexponential function.},

abstract = {This paper presents new insights into the appearance of agriculture at the north-western edge of Europe, focussing on archaeobotanical evidence from Neolithic Ireland (4000-2500calBC). Previous studies were based upon a limited plant macro-remains dataset, as much of the Irish evidence is unpublished. A research project, 'Cultivating Societies', was implemented to examine the nature, timing and extent of agricultural activity in Neolithic Ireland through collation and analysis of different strands of published and unpublished archaeological and environmental evidence, with a particular focus on plant macro-remains, pollen, settlement and 14C data. This paper will focus on results of plant macro-remains analyses. Remains from a total of 52 excavated sites were collated and analysed, representing the most comprehensive study to date of Neolithic plant remains from this region. Cereals were present at many locations and site types, sometimes in large quantities and most often at sites dating to the earlier Neolithic (3750-3600calBC). Emmer wheat was the dominant crop, at least at this time. Other crops included naked and hulled barley, naked wheat, einkorn wheat and flax. Analysis of arable weeds indicates that early plots were not managed under a shifting cultivation regime, which has new implications for understanding Neolithic settlement practises and how communities engaged with landscapes. The variety of crops cultivated in Neolithic Ireland is similar to that in Britain, reflecting a decreasing diversity in crop types as agriculture spread from south-east to north-west Europe.},

abstract = {Agricultural landscapes presently cover about 46 {\%} of earth terrestrial surface. This cultivated area is decreasing, whereas the global food demand is projected to increase up to 70 {\%} in 2050. The intensification of agriculture is not a solution to this food issue because intensive agriculture has often resulted in pollution and loss of biodiversity. On the other hand, mechanistic models with optimization algorithms can be used to design alternative land uses for sustainable agriculture. Here, we present a review of metaheuristics for land use optimization reported in 50 articles including 38 case studies carried out in 16 countries. Our main conclusions are: 1) the success of metaheuristics is problem-dependent. In general, metaheuristics enable search to escape from local optima and find a good global approximation solution. 2) The choice of a given metaheuristic for solving a given problem seems to be driven by its historical use in a research team and by its popularity outside the metaheuristics research community, rather than by the characteristics of the problems to be solved and by the latest results from the metaheuristics research community. 3) Stakeholders of land use are increasingly involved at different levels of the land use optimization procedure and multi-actors decision-making methods are necessary to find trade-offs between their competing interests. 4) A future challenge is the use of parallelization techniques along with the hybridization of different metaheuristics or of metaheuristics with other optimization methods.},

A compilation of finds of free threshing wheat for Northern Europe based on a temporal resolution of Funnel Beaker sub-periods shows the importance of free threshing wheat-independent of genomic constitution-in the Early Neolithic Funnel Beaker crop assemblage. Based on this new evidence, we assume that the crop assemblages of the first farmers on the North European Plain consisted of three main cereals: emmer, barley and free threshing wheat. Both the new finds and the compilation of free threshing wheat finds support the scenario of a chronological separation of different agricultural systems that were implemented within different Funnel Beaker phases. Furthermore, the evidence for tetraploid free threshing wheat shows that the tradition of early Funnel Beaker groups is linked to southwestern agricultural developments, for example, of the Michelsberg group. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

The results of the Target MOTAD Model indicate an optimal cropping pattern of growing sorghum, rice and soyabeans. This is different from the existing cropping pattern of sorghum, sunflower, cotton and maize. The overall policy implication of adopting the cropping pattern obtained from the model solution is that some resources allocated to the production of current crops have to be reallocated to the production of new crops. Moreover, since people in the Gwembe Valley are used to growing of cotton, sunflower and maize, the adoption of the suggested new crops will entail the education of the people (through extension services) in the crop husbandry of these crops. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

abstract = {We present paleoeconomy reconstructions for premodern agriculture, selecting, wherever required, features and parameter values specific for the Cucuteni–Trypillia cultural unity (CTU; 5400–2700 BC, mostly the territory of modern Ukraine, Moldova, and Romania). We verify the self-consistency and viability of the archaeological evidence related to all major elements of the agricultural production cycle within the constraints provided by environmental and technological considerations. The starting point of our analysis is the paleodiet structure suggested by archaeological data, stable isotope analyses of human remains, and palynology studies in the CTU area. We allow for the archeologically attested contributions of domesticated and wild animal products to the diet, develop plausible estimates of the yield of ancient cereal varieties cultivated with ancient techniques, and quantify the yield dependence on the time after initial planting and on rainfall (as a climate proxy). Our conclusions involve analysis of the labor costs of various seasonal parts of the agricultural cycle of both an individual and a family with a majority of members that do not engage in productive activities that require physical fitness, such as tillage. Finally, we put our results into the context of the exploitation territory and catchment analysis, to project various subsistence strategies into the exploitation territory of a farming settlement. The simplest economic complex based on cereals and domestic and wild animal products, with fallow cropping, appears to be capable of supporting an isolated, relatively small farming settlement of 50–300 people (2–10 ha in area) even without recourse to technological improvements such as the use of manure fertilizer. Our results strongly suggest that dairy products played a significant role in the dietary and labor balance. The smaller settlements are typical of the earliest Trypillia A stage but remain predominant at the later stages. A larger settlement of several hundred people could function in isolation, perhaps with a larger fraction of cereals in the diet, only with technological innovations, such as manure fertilizer and, most important, ard tillage. The ard radically relieves the extreme time pressure associated with soil preparation for sowing. It appears that very large settlements of a few hundred hectares in area, found in the CTU region, could function only if supported by satellite farming villages and stable exchange networks. In turn, this implies social division of labor and occupation, sufficiently complex social relations, stable exchange channels, and so on: altogether, a proto-urban character of such settlements. A model is proposed for the lifetime of a farming settlement, assuming that it is limited by the soil fertility (the depleted resources model), that provides a lifetime estimate consistent with the archaeological evidence available (100–150 years).},

The present work introduces a model of opinion formation specifically designed to address risk judgments, such as attitudes towards climate change, terrorist threats, or children vaccination. The model assumes that people collect risk information from the media environment and exchange them locally with other individuals. Even though individuals are initially exposed to the same sample of information, the model predicts the emergence of opinion polarization and clustering. In particular, numerical simulations highlight two crucial factors that determine the collective outcome: the propensity of individuals to search for independent information, and the strength of social influence. This work provides a quantitative framework to anticipate and manage how the public responds to a given risk, and could help understanding the systemic amplification of fears and worries, or the underestimation of real dangers. {\textcopyright} 2013 Moussa{\"{i}}d.},

abstract = {Aim To describe patterns of crop richness at a global scale and investigate the potential influence of energy, water, habitat heterogeneity, area and economic commitment to agricultural practices on patterns of crop species richness. Location World-wide. Methods Ethnographic literature for 86 subsistence-oriented societies was surveyed; 55 of these societies grow crops and 31 do not. These 86 societies occupy the range of latitudes at which subsistence-oriented groups manage domesticated plant species. The number of domesticated plants that each society cultivates is reported. Regression analyses were conducted to evaluate predictions for relationships between crop richness, energy, area, habitat heterogeneity, commitment to cultivation and species taxonomic descriptions. Results Crop richness is positively and significantly related to energy availability and commitment to cultivation. The warmer the environment in which cultivators live, the more crop species cultivators grow. The more subsistence farmers commit to cultivation, the more crop species subsistence farmers grow. Above a threshold of 500m in elevation range, crop richness is positively related to topographic heterogeneity. Mean annual rainfall, elevation, area, commitment to domesticated animals and exchange are not significantly related to crop richness. Main conclusions Crop richness in subsistence-oriented farming systems is conditioned by energy availability via the physiological tolerances of crop species. Crop richness is secondarily conditioned by topographic heterogeneity, which may serve as an estimate of spatial climatic heterogeneity. Where energy availability is a relatively weak constraint on crop production, commitment to cultivation for subsistence strongly conditions how much effort producers invest in diversifying their crop base. It is postulated that tolerance to freezing temperatures limits the ranges of domesticated plant species. This range limitation might be the result of niche conservation among domesticated crop species and a legacy of greater rates of speciation and lower rates of extinction among 'free living' species in tropical settings. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {The analysis of carbon isotope discrimination ($\Delta$) in crop seeds from archaeological sites may help to assess yield during early agriculture. Wheat was among the first crops to be domesticated in the Near East. Here, a yield model based on $\Delta$ in grains from present-day crops of durum wheat (Triticum durum Def.) is developed using a wide range of genotypes, most of which were cultivated in the Eastern Mediterranean basin (Syria). A strong positive linear regression (r 2 =0•72) between yield on a logarithmic basis and grain $\Delta$ was observed. Initial estimates of ancient wheat yields were then obtained by fitting the $\Delta$ values of archaeological grains to the above relationship. The yield estimates were subsequently corrected to take into consideration the two main differences between ancient and modern crops not accounted for by the $\Delta$ of ancient samples: Atmospheric CO 2 levels and grain/total above-ground biomass ratio. The model was then used to estimate yields of naked wheat (Triticum durumlaestivum) attained at Tell Halula, an early agricultural site, ranging from Middle Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB, c. 9550 BP calibrated) to Late Neolithic (Pre-Halaf, c. 8630 BP calibrated). This is the earliest archaeological settlement in the Middle Euphrates region (Rakka Governorate, Syria) at which the cultivation of domesticated naked wheat has been reported. Productivity, calculated from $\Delta$ of wheat grains found at this site, was relatively high, with an average (mean ± S.D.) of 1•56 ± 0•28 Mg ha -1 . Although these yields are well below those attained in this region by present-day wheat crops under irrigation (e.g. 3•83 Mg ha -1 , mean value for 1987-1996 period at Rakka Governorate), they are higher than those achieved for wheat under the current rainfed conditions of this semi-arid region (1•05 Mg ha -1 ) and suggest natural growing conditions were wetter than those than are prevalent today. In addition, our estimates for Tell Halula suggest that Neolithic agricultural practices may have produced greater yields than those to be expected from stands of wild cereals, which would have favoured the transition from gathering to cultivation.},

abstract = {Gambles are random variables that model possible changes in monetary wealth. Classic decision theory transforms money into utility through a utility function and defines the value of a gamble as the expectation value of utility changes. Utility functions aim to capture individual psychological characteristics, but their generality limits predictive power. Expectation value maximizers are defined as rational in economics, but expectation values are only meaningful in the presence of ensembles or in systems with ergodic properties, whereas decision-makers have no access to ensembles and the variables representing wealth in the usual growth models do not have the relevant ergodic properties. Simultaneously addressing the shortcomings of utility and those of expectations, we propose to evaluate gambles by averaging wealth growth over time. No utility function is needed, but a dynamic must be specified to compute time averages. Linear and logarithmic "utility functions" appear as transformations that generate ergodic observables for purely additive and purely multiplicative dynamics, respectively. We highlight inconsistencies throughout the development of decision theory, whose correction clarifies that our perspective is legitimate. These invalidate a commonly cited argument for bounded utility functions.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018. The Authors. While it is known that farmers adopt different decision-making behaviors to cope with stresses, it remains challenging to capture this diversity in formal model frameworks that are used to advance theory and inform policy. Guided by cognitive theory and the theory of bounded rationality, this research develops a novel, socio-hydrological model framework that can explore how a farmer's perception of water availability impacts crop choice and water allocation. The model is informed by a rich empirical data set at the household level collected during 2013 in Kenya's Upper Ewaso Ng'iro basin that shows that the crop type cultivated is correlated with water availability. The model is able to simulate this pattern and shows that near-optimal or “satisficing” crop patterns can emerge also when farmers were to make use of simple decision rules and have diverse perceptions on water availability. By focusing on farmer decision making it also captures the rebound effect, i.e., as additional water becomes available through the improvement of crop efficiencies it will be reallocated on the farm instead of flowing downstream, as a farmer will adjust his (her) water allocation and crop pattern to the new water conditions. This study is valuable as it is consistent with the theory of bounded rationality, and thus offers an alternative, descriptive model in addition to normative models. The framework can be used to understand the potential impact of climate change on the socio-hydrological system, to simulate and test various assumptions regarding farmer behavior and to evaluate policy interventions.},

abstract = {It is thought that direct personal experience of extreme weather events could result in greater public engagement and policy response to climate change. Based on this premise, we present a set of future climate scenarios for Ireland communicated in the context of recent, observed extremes. Specifically, we examine the changing likelihood of extreme seasonal conditions in the long-term observational record, and explore how frequently such extremes might occur in a changed Irish climate according to the latest model projections. Over the period (1900-2014) records suggest a greater than 50-fold increase in the likelihood of the warmest recorded summer (1995), whilst the likelihood of the wettest winter (1994/95) and driest summer (1995) has respectively doubled since 1850. The most severe end-of-century climate model projections suggest that summers as cool as 1995 may only occur once every ∼7 years, whilst winters as wet as 1994/95 and summers as dry as 1995 may increase by factors of ∼8 and ∼10 respectively. Contrary to previous research, we find no evidence for increased wintertime storminess as the Irish climate warms, but caution that this conclusion may be an artefact of the metric employed. It is hoped that framing future climate scenarios in the context of extremes from living memory will help communicate the scale of the challenge climate change presents, and in so doing bridge the gap between climate scientists and wider society.},

abstract = {This is the first full-length treatment of food supply and food crisis in classical antiquity. Hunger was never far away in the world of Greece and Rome, yet ancient historians have generally left unexplored the role of the food supply in shaping the central institutions and practices of ancient society. This book demonstrates that a study of systems of food supply and their breakdown leads to a fuller understanding of political behaviour, social mechanisms and economic relationships in classical antiquity.Dr Garnsey poses the following questions: What caused food crisis? Was it a common feature of the Mediterranean region in antiquity; how frequently did it assume the proportions of famine? What 'famine relief' measures developed in urban communities; did popular pressure play a role in their evolution? How adequate were those measures? Did different political systems find different solutions to the problems of supply and distribution of food? How did the peasantry, who made up the bulk of the population, cope in the face of the constraints imposed by nature and man?The author provides detailed case studies of Athens and Rome, the best known states of antiquity, but also illuminates the responses to the problems of the food supply in the mass of ordinary cities and rural communities in the Mediterranean world between roughly 600 BC and AD 500.The book will be of interest to ancient historians studying the politics, economy and society of classical antiquity; it will be of equal importance to social scientists of all kinds concerned with the problems of famine and food supply in other complex societies and those who have become attuned to the issue of world hunger and areseeking a longer perspective. It is written with the non-specialist in mind as well as the scholar.},
annote = {p. 6
A brief working definition of famine might run as follows: 
Famine is a critical shortage of essential foodstuffs leading through hunger to starvation and a substantially increased ortality rate in a community or region.
Famine is to be distinguished from shortage, a milder form of substistence crisis, defined as:
A short-term reduction in the amount of available foodstuffs, as indicated by rising prices, popular discontent, hunger, in the worst cases bordering on starvation.
Food crises are not always serious. Famine is acatastrophe. It is a categorical error, committed frequently in the literature, to describe every food crisis as a famine.
...The proposition for which I will argue is that famines were rare, but that subsistence cirses falling short of famine were commmon.

p.9 - 'regional diversity and interrannual variability' . . . first, the climate of the med is (and always has been) exceptionally diverse from region to region, a ppoint not lost on Aristotle: 'sometimes it happens that droughts or rain occur over a large area, sometimes over a part; often the country as w hole recieves the seasonal rains ormore, while in some sectionsof the area there is drought; sometimes it is the opposite, and the area generally has either slight rainfall or even conditions of drought, while in a given section the share of water is abundant.

p. 10 'Crop falure is neither a sufficient nor a necessary condtion of food crisis, but it does underlie many such crises. For the most part a corp fails because of insufficient or excessive rainfall at the cirical period of plant growht. In the {\textless}editerranean the growth period comprises the omnths rom October to May.

***p.14 In the world of hte Graeco-Roman city the alleviation of food crises by private benefactors was so regular as to be an instituionalized fature ofthe society. The same peple also accepted appointment, sometimes singly, sometimes with others, as offficals with special responsibility for the grian supply, sitonai or grain commissioners, sitophulakes or grian wardens, or some other such name . . . Where the office was hereditary or was held for life, as for example in Sparta, then the implications for the community in question are manifest and grim."

p17 Table 3 shows that harvest failure is considerabley more likely to occur in one year than in two years in succession. Thus, where drought is an important precipitaitong cause fo food cirsis, genuine famines are much rarer than mere shortages. 

p.44 Peasants have been deined as 'small produces on land who, with the help of simple equipment, their onw labour and that of their families, produce mainly for their own consumption nand for meeting obligations to the holders of political and economic power, and reach nearly total self sufficiency within the framework of a village community.

p.50 Mixed ceral and legume cultivation has been a common pattern in traditional Mediterranean agriculture.

***p.56 Reciprocal exchange was a more desireable alternative. Producers exchanged outsidd the market with others from the same community, typically kinsmen and neighbors, in order to acquire goods which were temporarily lacking folloing a bad or mediocre harvest. Such relationhsip s might extend also to peaseants in other communities no great distance away. It is worth recalling that both climate and yield vary strikingly both bewteen and within regions in the Med, and that such variation was particularly marked in the broken landscapes of greece and Italy.

**p.73 The ordinary cities of the MEditerranean, then, were linked by informal or formal understandings and agreements that were brought into operation in times of eneed, with private traders functioning as middlement. The task of activating these preexisting relationhips on any particular occasion wasa pbulic service (as opposed to a regular magsitracy) undertaken by one or more officials with special responsibility for the grain supply.},

abstract = {Cultivation of agave was common in pre- Hispanic northern Mexico and the American Southwest, and scholars generally accept that it was a strategy to ensure food supply during years of drought when the maize crop failed. Some even suggest that incorporating agave culti- vation make large, nucleated settlements possible in arid northern Mexico ca. 500–900 CE. Yet the environmental circumstances under which farmers could reasonably expect such a strategy to decrease the chances of agricultural failure are not well understood. We explore the potential of this crop complementarity by assessing the risk of famine-induced migration events in different idealized environmental settings. We use Monte Carlo simulation to analyze a simple discrete-time, age-structured stochastic model for maize and agave agroecology, deriving the climatological conditions under which agave could have significantly reduced the probability of short- and long-term famine events. Investments in agave production made the most sense where average annual rainfall was between the levels that would ensure maximum maize yield and those that would mean loss of the maize crop due to drought- related mortality. Cultivating agave had little impact on famine risk at high (maize yields sufficient) and low (failure of both maize and agave) rainfall levels. Perhaps more surprisingly, it had its highest impact at moderate rainfall levels when variance in rainfall was relatively low. While a higher variance in rainfall increased the number of ‘good' years for maize—where production would exceed demand and allow for storage—it also increased the probability of simultaneous failures in both agave and maize production. These findings are difficult to apply to specific times and places in the past, because rainfall distribution in complex, environments change, and it is difficult to take all relevant human interventions into account. The analysis does, however, offer support for the proposition that agave cultivation could have significantly enhanced survival probabilities of large, nucleated settlements in certain circumstances. It remains for further study to identify such circumstances more precisely geographically and temporally.},

Many of these long-lived SESs have adapted their institutions to the particular pattern of variability they have experienced over time as well as to the broader economic, political, and social system in which they are located. Such adaptations alter resource use patterns in time and/or space to maintain the configuration of the SESs. Even well-adapted SESs, however, can become vulnerable to new types of disturbances. Through the analysis of a series of case studies, we begin to characterize different types of adaptations to particular types of variability and explore vulnerabilities that may emerge as a result of this adaptive process. Understanding such vulnerabilities may be critical if our interest is to contribute to the future adaptations of SESs as the more rapid processes of globalization unfold.},

In this paper, we look at the institutional configurations that affect the interactions among resources, resource users, public infrastructure providers, and public infrastructures. We propose a framework that helps identify potential vulnerabilities of SESs to disturbances. All the links between components of this framework can fail and thereby reduce the robustness of the system. We posit that the link between resource users and public infrastructure providers is a key variable affecting the robustness of SESs that has frequently been ignored in the past. We illustrate the problems caused by a disruption in this link. We then briefly describe the design principles originally developed for robust common-pool resource institutions, because they appear to be a good starting point for the development of design principles for more general SESs and do include the link between resource users and public infrastructure providers.},

However, the social and ecological consequences of activities dealing with short-term disturbances may increase the vulnerability of the system to infrequent events or to long-term change in patterns of short-term variability. Exploring this possibility requires the study of long-term, transformational change. The archaeological record provides many examples of long-term change, such as the Hohokam who occupied the Phoenix Basin for over a thousand years and developed a complex irrigation society. In the 14th century, Hohokam society experienced a reduction in complexity and scale possibly associated with regional climatic events. We apply a framework designed to explore robustness in coupled social-ecological systems to the Hohokam Cultural Sequence. Based on this analysis, a stylized formal model is developed to explore the possibility that the success of the Hohokam irrigation system and associated social structure may have increased their vulnerability to rare climactic shocks.},

abstract = {Modern Syria, and in particular the Middle Euphrates valley, has been occupied and overexploited since the beginnings of agriculture. Thus, the study of the economic and environmental characteristics of ancient settlements may offer new perspectives on the long-term effects of continuous agriculture in a fragile agroecosystem. In this work, we present a methodological framework that uses archaeological information to understand long-term effects of the extensification of agriculture in present-time arid areas. Specifically, we have compared the main economic features of a Neolithic site of the middle Euphrates, Tell Halula (ca. 10th millennium BP), with present-day data from the surrounding region. Population, crop distribution, cereal yields and arable land requirements during the first millennia after the emergence of agriculture were estimated from archaeological data and compared with a compilation of present-time official statistics and data derived from a field survey. We observed a trend towards a cereal-based farming during the Neolithic, associated to a decrease in the diversity of wild florae. This was accompanied by a growth in population during the earliest phases of the settlement (8200-7000 cal BCE), followed by a decline in population in the late phases (7000-5400 cal BCE), probably as a consequence of exceeding the capacity of the agroecosystem. A comparable situation to that found in early phases of Tell Halula was observed in modern communities, showing similar growth rates and a strong focus on cereal crops. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Identifying how ancient societies made decisions about agriculture and land use is important for understanding why some pre-industrial agricultural systems flourished and others collapsed. Environmental archaeological data offer a unique diachronic perspective on the ephemerality or sustainability of agriculture in a particular place. This dissertation considers paleoethnobotanical and related archaeological evidence for changes in landscape and agricultural practices at the ancient city of Gordion in central Anatolia (modern Turkey) over a period of more than 2000 years, from the Late Bronze Age to the Medieval period. In order to interpret these data, agricultural and land-use strategies are modeled as a set of decision-making processes based on principles of human behavioral ecology and foraging theory, the study of how people make subsistence decisions in the context of social and biological environments. Wood charcoal remains from Gordion show a pattern of long-term forest succession in the region. Wood acquisition strategies at Gordion appear to have focused on the use of local, available tree types for fuel but on more distant forest woods for construction. This is likely due to the lack of tall, straight juniper and pine in the immediate proximity of the site after the Late Bronze Age due to deforestation and resultant forest succession. Paleoethnobotanical macroremains from Gordion indicate that a mixed agropastoral system focused on cereal cultivation and sheep and goat herding was standard during all periods of occupation. Shifts in regional demographics and political and economic systems, however, resulted in changing agricultural strategies between periods. Higher levels of population and economic success led to agricultural intensification and a decline in subsistence diversity, a traditional risk-management strategy. Increased population density resulted in overgrazing and steppe degradation in the immediate area of Gordion, increasing erosion and causing substantial alluviation of the Sakarya River. In contrast, climate change seems to have been only a minor factor influencing [and-use decisions at Gordion. A diversified agropastoral system, with dry farming of cereals and pulses and extensive herding, appears to have been the most sustainable agricultural strategy at Gordion over the long term.},

abstract = {A statistical method is developed to generate local cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of surface climate variables from large-scale fields. Contrary to most downscaling methods producing continuous time series, our "probabilistic downscaling methods'' (PDMs), named "CDF-transform'', is designed to deal with and provide local-scale CDFs through a transformation applied to large-scale CDFs. First, our PDM is compared to a reference method (Quantile-matching), and validated on a historical time period by downscaling CDFs of wind intensity anomalies over France, for reanalyses and simulations from a general circulation model (GCM). Then, CDF-transform is applied to GCM output fields to project changes in wind intensity anomalies for the 21st century under A2 scenario. Results show a decrease in wind anomalies for most weather stations, ranging from less than 1{\%} (in the South) to nearly 9{\%} (in the North), with a maximum in the Brittany region.

Although a general trend of environmental stress through increasing aridity is indicated in the stable carbon isotopes of archaeobotanical barley remains of Middle Bronze Age sites (from ca. 2000 BC), archaeobotanical patterns indicate that this effect was insufficient to lead to an area-wide abandonment of settlements.Continuous change of environmental parameters such as climate variation, anthropogenic impact on the environment, population growth, cultural and ethical diversity in human groups, and the impossibility of finding a consensus on questions important to decision-making can lead to very diverse effects in economy and question the validity of sustainability concepts. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

(p. 1)"several hundred thousand plant remains have been collected from 11 archaeological sites (Tell Atchana, Kinet H{\"{o}}y{\"{u}}k, Tell Mozan, Tell Halaf, Tell Tawila, Emar, Tell el ' Abd, Qatna, Tell Fadous, Zeraqon and Zincirli) using the standard methods in archaeobotanical sampling of Near Eastern site" (p. 2)"Agronomic references on water requirements of the crops have been used to assess their potential sensitivity to increasing aridity ( Riehl, 2009a )." (p. 2)"It is well known that C3 plants growing under reduced water availability have reduced carbon fi xation from CO 2 in their vegetative tissues due to reduced photosynthesis by stomatal closure that protects plants from dehydration ( Araus et al.,1997; Ehleringer et al., 1986; Farquhar et al., 1982 ). Despite the dominant role of water availability in carbon fi xation, the causes of variation in D 13 C are complex and not always straightforward, as many other factors can be involved ( Dawson et al., 2002 ). In arid and semi-arid environments, however, increased water stress accounts for the largest part of D 13 C variation (3 e 6 {\&} according to Tieszen, 1991 ). In this type of environment, stress caused by salinity can in fl uence D 13 C variation in the same way, although this aspect seems to have been investigated mainly in halophytes. Low nutrient content in soils can result in D 13 C variation in the other direction (3 e 5 {\&} ), thus neutralizing the signal of water stress (see Tieszen, 1991 , table 1, p. 230). Tieszen (1991) suggests that this aspect is a minor concern in archeology." (p. 2)"In presence, proportion, and ubiquity, barley ( Hordeum spp.) is consistently the main cereal crop throughout the Early and Middle Bronze Age Near East. Today, a dominance of barley is a common feature in arid and semi-arid environments due to its short reproduction cycle preventing the crop from extensive drought stress" (p. 3)"The proportions of the hulled wheats emmer ( Triticum dicoccum ) and einkorn ( Triticum monococcum ) were particularly low in central North Syria during the Early Bronze Age. In contrast, the ubiquity of emmer is high in this area, indicating a regular use of this species, while einkorn, the cereal with the lowest yield structure and relatively high water requirements, seems to be near extinct in the whole Near East by the Middle Bronze Age. Emmer is considered a highly drought-resistant species due to its high waterholding capacity, and it can also be considered with high probability a salt-tolerant species, and therefore an ef fi cient cereal crop in arid environments (for details see Riehl, 2009a )." (p. 3)"Gr ape ( Vitis vinifera L. ssp. vinifera ) was cultivated over a large area during the Early Bronze Age, although in larger proportions mainly in areas with modern mean annual precipitation above 400 mm. Cultivation during the Early Bronze Age seems to have been practiced considerably southward of the natural distribution of the wild progenitor ( V. vinifera ssp. sylvestris ). Allowing for fewer analyzed Middle Bronze Age sites, grape cultivation generally seems to be reduced during this period, particularly in the central part of northern Syria." (p. 3)"In all, the archaeobotanical crop patterns indicate disappearance or reduction in drought-susceptible species, and in particular in fl ax, garden pea, and grape in many areas of the Near East from the Early to the Middle Bronze Age, while drought-tolerant species tend to increase or remain unchanged" (p. 3)"The correlation with the 4.200 BP event can be further speci fi ed for some cases, such as Tell Mozan on the upper Khabur. The archaeobotanical evidence from the site supports major fl uctuations toward the end of the Early Bronze Age. It indicates a short-term shift to increased moisture during the fi nal phase of the Early Bronze Age (c. 2100 e 2000 BC), directly related to a shift in crop production from barley to free-threshing wheat for roughly one century, and another shift back to barley, accompanied by dryland wild species after 2000 BC ( Riehl, 2010 )." (p. 3)", a particular characteristic of the Early Bronze Age Euphrates region is extremely high proportions of" (p. 3)"The cultivation of olive ( Olea europaea L.) was relatively restricted to an area close to the Mediterranean coast during the Early Bronze Age and became regionally even more reduced in the Middle Bronze Age." (p. 3)"barley in some sites, a pattern that has been interpreted as a kind of " monoculture " of barley in Early Bronze Age Euphrates settlements in contrast to the upper Khabur settlements ( Riehl and Bryson, 2007 ). During the Middle Bronze Age, however, there seems to be a slightly contrary trend to somewhat higher barley proportions in the Khabur area and lower proportions in the Euphrates region." (p. 4)"The archaeobotanical remains of three sites (Tell Mozan, Tell Brak, Tell Atij) roughly dating between 2600 and 2300 BC) on a north-south line of roughly 100 km, spanning a precipitation regime from 100 to 150 mm at Tell Atij to 200 e 250 mm at Tell Mozan in the months from December to February, support the conclusion on the importance of the precipitation regime for the composition of the archaeobotanical assemblage. Attribute plots of speci fi c taxa further con fi rm this, with high proportions in plant taxa of open and disturbed habitats ( Astragalus spp., Liliaceae) at Tell Atij, high proportions of barley at Tell Brak and of freethreshing wheat at Tell Mozan ( Riehl and Bryson, 2007 )." (p. 5)"Another difference in rainfall patterns in the western and eastern Fertile Crescent is the number and timing of main precipitation periods with the typical Mediterranean winter precipitation regime in the west and a regime with two rainy seasons in the east, in the beginning of spring and the end of autumn and with a winter drought that is less pronounced and shorter than the summer drought ( Alex, 1985 ). These different regimes correlate well with the natural distribution of wild olive and win" (p. 5)"While at Soreq Cave ( Bar-Matthews and Ayalon, 1998; 2011 ) drier conditions are indicated in der d 18 O record at 4200 BP and ancient water levels at Lake Kineret ( Hazan et al., 2005 ) started to decrease at the same time, carbonate cutans in southeast Turkey stopped growing roughly around 4100 BP ( Pustovoytov et al., 2007 ). A closer look at the oxygen isotopic record from Lake Van ( Lemcke and Sturm, 1997; Wick et al., 2003 ) shows long-term trends of increasing aridity after 4000 BP rather than speci fi c peaks, which would correlate with an individual event." (p. 5)"A major methodological problem is differences in chronological resolution in all of the mentioned records, as the number of measurements within a certain sequence determines the number and chronological placement of fl uctuations creating locally individual patterns (compare the measured d 18 O record and the smoothed curved in Bar-Matthews and Ayalon, 2011 )." (p. 5)"Most of the archaeological sites in Syria lie in an area of 200 e 400 mm of modern mean annual precipitation, i.e., in an area very sensitive to any decrease in precipitation. There are two possible scenarios for the past. Under an assumption that modern and ancient mean precipitation are more or less equal, the settlements in regions below the critical 400 mm isohyet should have been under permanent risk of crop failure in occasionally occurring drought years. Alternatively the ancient isohyets may have been further south, allowing these settlements to develop a prosperous agriculture." (p. 5)"The mean actual precipitation in a series of drought years, such as between 1957 and 1961, may be 100 e 200 mm below the longterm mean annual precipitation (i.e., the 250 mm isohyet in such drought years is equivalent to the 400 mm isohyet of the long-term mean), causing a continuous sequence of crop failures in areas with long-term mean annual precipitation below 400 mm ( Wirth,1971 ). Recent research on variation in precipitation shows reasonable evidence of multi-year to decadal cyclicity in the past ( Touchan et al., 1999, 2003 ), i.e., the occurrence of droughts for duration of three years or longer" (p. 6)"A strongly specialized population may perceive a drought more intense than a group of people with highly diversi fi ed subsistence strategies, which may result in quite different behavior between these groups, but also within the groups, as the studies by Kates (1970) and by Heathcote (1980 ; there e.g. table 4.9) impressively show" (p. 6)----------Riehl{\_}Variability in ancient Near Eastern environmental and agricultural development.pdf

The hypothesis of a causal relationship between correlated proxy palaeoclimate and archaeobotanical data is tested with the independent evidence from stable carbon isotope analysis in plant remains. Ancient plant remains show that D13C is decreased for Middle Bronze Age objects, which coincides chronologically with a broad pattern of drier climate inferred from several palaeoclimate proxy records. The hypothesis of a causal relation between climate change and farming is valid, thus archaeobotanical data are suitable for investigating past relations between climate change and agro-production on a broader scale.},

In this study, applications have been made to the choice of type of farming, optimum dosage of fertiliser and manure and the most appropriate time of selling agricultural produce.

abstract = {We compare the robustness of food supplies to annual variation in rainfall within two different agricultural systems: a generalist system with one type of agent who cultivates both maize and agave, and a specialist system composed of two types of agents who cultivate either maize or agave and are able to exchange. When mean rainfall is relatively high and less variable or relatively low and more variable, food supplies in the specialist system are more robust than in the generalist system. However, at intermediate levels of mean rainfall and variability, food supplies in the specialist system are less robust than those in the generalist system. Our analysis suggests that conflicts of interest and their associated costs constrain the development of specialization in some environments. When considering the robustness of social-ecological systems, it is important to consider “for whom a coupled social and ecological system is robust?”},

"Finally, by treating U T as a parameter, we assume that the total area that farmers devote to a particular crop (a decision based on many years of accumulated experience) changes more slowly than the choices that a farmer makes about the amount of maize or agave to gift on an annual basis (a decision based on annual rainfall variation)." (p. 299)
"The rainfall-productivity function does not consider how too much water would impact the productivity of maize" (p. 300)
"As a perennial plant, an agave population will exhibit age structure with individuals distributed across different cohorts." (p. 300)
they use density dependent growth for agave. should we do the same for sheep? (note on p.300)
 
"The exchange dynamics in our model system occur in a social market (Fiske 1992 ) as opposed to a monetized market (Heyman and Ariely 2004 ). The logic of exchange in social markets is often based on ritual and kin-based obligations rather than maximizing profit per se (Henrich et al . 2004 ; Sahlins 1972 ; Mauss 2006 )" (p. 300)
"A famine event of length i is simply the number of consecutive years when the minimum level of food required by a given representative agent is not achieved." (p. 302)
"When robustness is assessed in terms of discrete famine events, the food supply of the agave specialists is less vulnerable than the food supply of the generalist and maize specialists for all levels of mean rainfall. Maize specialists, on the other hand, experience more famine events than the generalist, except when mean rainfall drops to 55 units. At first glance, these results suggest that specialization provides a big advantage for agave specialists, but giving up their direct access to maize results in a subtle vulnerability." (p. 303)
"The agave specialists reduce their total famine events by eating excess agave in good years and storing their gifted maize. This strategy buffers the agave specialists against occasional dry years that wipe out juvenile cohorts of agave; however, the potential exists for dry years to occur consecutively causing successive cohorts of agave to fail. Under these conditions, agave yields may drop to zero for a decade at a time and agave specialists experience, on average, a large number of total famine years. This means that over an average 100-year time interval, the agave specialists spend almost a third of the time (31.1 years) in famine, even when mean rainfall is 100 units! By specializing, the agave specialists trade-off robustness to frequent, small deficits in rainfall for extreme vulnerability to less frequent, large deficits in rainfall." (p. 303)
"can food preferences be easily redefined, or are they entrenched by high social or physiological costs?" (p. 303)
"The solution that maximizes robustness for the group as a whole does not necessarily confer equal advantages to all group members." (p. 305)
"Our comparison of models indicates that in some social-ec ological conditions a specialized system with exchange outperform s a generalist system, in terms of the robustness of farmers ' supply of food to variation in rainfall." (p. 306)
"These observations suggest that to increase their robustness to famine, farmers in productive and less variable environments or extremely variable and unproductive environments should adopt a specialist strategy rather than be generalists." (p. 306)
"Our results are consistent with the long known pattern in ecology that specialization is more common in productive and less variable environments (Pianka 1973 )." (p. 306)
"We hypothesize that social diversity based on specialization and exchange may be constrained in environments where the production of resources is highly uncertain or unproductive due to the emergence of conflicts of interest between social actors." (p. 306)
"Cashdan ( 2001 ) has suggested that in subsistence-oriented human economies, the formation of specialization and exchange systems may occur in association with ethnic distinctions. For example, she has observed a negative correlation between ethnic diversity and inter-annual variation in rainfall, which could be explained by the emergence of conflicts of interest between members of different ethnic groups, or, as in our analysis, potential specialists, in uncertain environments." (p. 306)
"Thus, one hypothesis is that an agricultural economy based on specialization in maize and agave is more limited by inter-annual deviations in precipitation than the mean amount of precipitation. If a specialist system developed along the northern frontier and then climate shifted, even slightly increasing inter-annual variability in rainfall, this change would have strained the social relationships necessary for a specialist syste m to operate and possibly lead to a trajectory of social dissolution. Alternatively, it could trigger social tactics to coerce specialists to continue planting crops in ratios that were not in the interests of some farmers." (p. 307)
"Irrigation, however, provides an advantage in semi-arid environments by boosting the reliability of harvest (Mabry 2005 ). Thus, the addition of irrigation could significantly improve the robustness of the maize specialists ' food supply to drought. It is interesting, therefore, to note that irrigation ditches are evidenced in the Malpaso Valley floodplain near the site of La Quemada (Elliott et al . 2010 ). The irrigation of maize and specialization in agave production may go hand-in-hand because a sufficient degree of reliability in maize production is necessary for a specialist system to function" (p. 307)
"Parsons ( 2010 ), in fact, suggests that the expansion of traditional Mesoamerican life-ways into the northern frontier may have been driven by economic specialization in the production of agave and the exchange of agave products, especially for productive lake-zone resources from the central Mexican highlands" (p. 307)
"The production of textiles, in particular, could provide agave specialists with a durable good that has trade value apart from the starchy heart used for food. Thus, textiles and other durable-good agave products could be exchanged for food during times of need. In productive, but highly variable environments, agave specialists may be able to reduce their exposure to dry periods that produce long famines by producing textiles for trade. Even if agave hearts failed as a direct food source, stored textiles might be used to acquire food" (p. 307)

abstract = {This paper begins with the hypothesis that Mikea, participants in a mixed foraging - fishing - farming - herding economy of southwestern Madagascar, may attempt to reduce interannual variance in food supply caused by unpredictable rainfall by following a simple rule- of- thumb: Practice an even mix of activities that covary positively with rainfall and activities that covary negatively with rainfall. Results from a historical matrix participatory exercise confirm that Mikea perceive that foraging and farming outcomes covary positively or negatively with rainfall. This paper further considers whether Mikea learn about covariation through personal observation and memory recall ( individual learning) or through socially transmitted ethnotheory ( social learning). Dual inheritance theory models by Boyd and Richerson ( 1988) predict that individual learning is more effective in spatially and temporally variable environments such as the Mikea Forest. In contrast, the psychological literature suggests that individuals judge covariation poorly when memory of past events is required, unless they share a socially learned theory that a covariation should exist ( Nisbett and Ross 1980). Results suggest that Mikea rely heavily on shared ethnotheory when judging covariation, but individuals continually strive to improve their judgment through individual observation.},

abstract = {We present a computational model to explain the results from experiments in which subjects estimate the hidden probability parameter of a stepwise nonstationary Bernoulli process outcome by outcome. The model captures the following results qualitatively and quantitatively, with only 2 free parameters: (a) Subjects do not update their estimate after each outcome; they step from one estimate to another at irregular intervals. (b) The joint distribution of step widths and heights cannot be explained on the assumption that a threshold amount of change must be exceeded in order for them to indicate a change in their perception. (c) The mapping of observed probability to the median perceived probability is the identity function over the full range of probabilities. (d) Precision (how close estimates are to the best possible estimate) is good and constant over the full range. (e) Subjects quickly detect substantial changes in the hidden probability parameter. (f) The perceived probability sometimes changes dramatically from one observation to the next. (g) Subjects sometimes have second thoughts about a previous change perception, after observing further outcomes. (h) The frequency with which they perceive changes moves in the direction of the true frequency over sessions. (Explaining this finding requires 2 additional parametric assumptions.) The model treats the perception of the current probability as a by-product of the construction of a compact encoding of the experienced sequence in terms of its change points. It illustrates the why and the how of intermittent Bayesian belief updating and retrospective revision in simple perception. It suggests a reinterpretation of findings in the recent literature on the neurobiology of decision making. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Psychological Association.},

abstract = {To function effectively, brains need to make predictions about their environment based on past experience, i.e., they need to learn about their environment. The algorithms by which learning occurs are of interest to neuroscientists, both in their own right (because they exist in the brain) and as a tool to model participants' incomplete knowledge of task parameters and hence, to better understand their behavior. This review focusses on a particular challenge for learning algorithms-how to match the rate at which they learn to the rate of change in the environment, so that they use as much observed data as possible whilst disregarding irrelevant, old observations. To do this algorithms must evaluate whether the environment is changing. We discuss the concepts of likelihood, priors and transition functions, and how these relate to change detection. We review expected and estimation uncertainty, and how these relate to change detection and learning rate. Finally, we consider the neural correlates of uncertainty and learning. We argue that the neural correlates of uncertainty bear a resemblance to neural systems that are active when agents actively explore their environments, suggesting that the mechanisms by which the rate of learning is set may be subject to top down control (in circumstances when agents actively seek new information) as well as bottom up control (by observations that imply change in the environment). {\textcopyright} 2013 O'Reilly.},

We investigate this behavior in the context of a multi-armed bandit task. We compare human behavior to a variety of models that vary in their representational and computational complexity. Our result shows that subjects' choices, on a trial-totrial basis, are best captured by a "forgetful" Bayesian iterative learning model [21] in combination with a partially myopic decision policy known as Knowledge Gradient [7]. This model accounts for subjects' trial-by-trial choice better than a number of other previously proposed models, including optimal Bayesian learning and risk minimization, e-greedy and win-stay-lose-shift. It has the added benefit of being closest in performance to the optimal Bayesian model than all the other heuristic models that have the same computational complexity (all are significantly less complex than the optimal model). These results constitute an advancement in the theoretical understanding of how humans negotiate the tension between exploration and exploitation in a noisy, imperfectly known environment.},

Yet people flounder with even the simplest probability questions. What explains this apparent paradox? How can a supposedly Bayesian brain reason so poorly with probabilities? In this paper, we propose a direct and perhaps unexpected answer: that Bayesian brains need not represent or calculate probabilities at all and are, indeed, poorly adapted to do so. Instead, the brain is a Bayesian sampler. Only with infinite samples does a Bayesian sampler conform to the laws of probability; with finite samples it systematically generates classic probabilistic reasoning errors, including the unpacking effect, base-rate neglect, and the conjunction fallacy.},

abstract = {This paper examines the relationship between perceived risk and experience. This research addresses the processes by which people learn about risk and choose among real life prospects with associated uncertainties, risks and benefits. By comparing the impact of acute risk events with that of chronic risk events on public perception of risk during and after the events, this research focuses on the learning processes that characterize what kinds of risk events alter the perception of risk. Comparing materialized hazards at existing facilities with the risks associated with potential facilities, this research addresses risk choices among real life prospects. This study uses a classic pre-post quasi-experimental design. Surveys conducted in the Spring of 1992 on perceived and acceptable risk in Odessa and La Porte, Texas were conducted prior to risk events. Respondents from that survey were re- interviewed in the Spring of 1993 after the risk events to form a panel design. This paper analyzes the affect of risk events on perceived risk and the implications of these experiences for public policy concerning technological risk. The empirical results suggest that the social processes that construct and maintain risk in the public eye are at least as important as, if not more important than, the physical and psychological dimensions of risk.},

On the theoretical perspective, risk reduction based on asset diversification is a well studied mechanism in economics that has been formalized in the Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT). In this paper, we thus explore the opportunities for application of MPT to quantify the benefits of diversification for risk reduction in a context of highly diversified horticultural systems. Our analysis relies on a model of the effect of crop diversification on risk and expected yield. It is based on a dataset obtained from a range of 44 species and over a period of 10 years. Results show that (i) the variability of expected crop yield can be reduced up to 77{\%} by choosing the appropriate crop combination; (ii) most common crop classifications such as botanical classification or functional types do not make it possible to identify suitable diversification strategies. These results provide insight into how different horticultural crop combinations may shape the relationship between production and risk in diversified farming systems. Our findings also provide indications on new diversification strategies based on a quantification of risk reduction.},

abstract = {Researchers in judgment and decision making have long debunked the idea that we are economically rational optimizers. However, problematic assumptions of rationality remain common in studies of agricultural economics and climate change adaptation, especially those that involve quantitative models. Recent movement toward more complex agent-based modeling provides an opportunity to reconsider the empirical basis for farmer decision making. Here, we reconceptualize farmer decision making from the ground up, using an in situ mental models approach to analyze weather and climate risk management. We assess how large-scale commercial grain farmers in South Africa (n = 90) coordinate decisions about weather, climate variability, and climate change with those around other environmental, agronomic, economic, political, and personal risks that they manage every day. Contrary to common simplifying assumptions, we show that these farmers tend to satisfice rather than optimize as they face intractable and multifaceted uncertainty; they make imperfect use of limited information; they are differently averse to different risks; they make decisions on multiple time horizons; they are cautious in responding to changing conditions; and their diverse risk perceptions contribute to important differences in individual behaviors. We find that they use two important nonoptimizing strategies, which we call cognitive thresholds and hazy hedging, to make practical decisions under pervasive uncertainty. These strategies, evident in farmers' simultaneous use of conservation agriculture and livestock to manage weather risks, are the messy in situ performance of naturalistic decision-making techniques. These results may inform continued research on such behavioral tendencies in narrower lab- and modeling-based studies.},

We investigate the effects of the different memory abilities of the agents, as well as the effects of the population's heterogeneity on their cognitive abilities. Our results of the emergent dynamics of the bar attendance suggest that the multi-agent simulation based on the IBL model is able to capture the dynamical properties of the EFBP reported in earlier work (Arthur, 1994). But most importantly, we show that the dynamics of bar attendance are sensitively dependent on the agents' cognitive abilities as described by the decay parameter in the IBL model. Furthermore, our results show that heterogeneity in their cognitive abilities may lead to the control of emergent dynamics.},

abstract = {Stress leads to an enhanced activity of the hypothalamus-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis resulting in an increased release of glucocorticoids from the adrenal cortex. These hormones influence target systems in the periphery as well as in the brain. The present review paper describes the impact of the human stress hormone cortisol on episodic long-term memory. Starting out with our early observation that stress as well as cortisol treatment impaired declarative memory, experiments by the author are described, which result in an enhanced understanding of how cortisol influences memory. The main conclusions are that stress or cortisol treatment temporarily blocks memory retrieval. The effect is stronger for emotional arousing material independent of its valence. In addition cortisol only influences memory when a certain amount of testing induced arousal occurs. A functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study suggests that the neuronal correlate of the cortisol induced retrieval blockade is a reduced activity of the hippocampus. In contrast to the effects on retrieval cortisol enhances memory consolidation. Again this effect is often stronger for emotionally arousing material and sometimes occurs at the cost of memory for neutral material. A fMRI study revealed that higher cortisol levels were associated with a stronger amygdala response to emotional stimuli. Thus stimulatory effects of cortisol on this structure might underlie the cortisol induced enhancement of emotional memory consolidation. The findings presented are in line with models derived from experiments in rodents and are of relevance for our understanding of stress associated psychiatric disorders. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Limiting factors on agricultural decisions change as the form of agriculture changes (from non-irrigated to irrigated). Policy implications specified" (Barlett 1978: 62). "The basis of peasant farmers' decision-making is a critical factor in the formation of agricultural policy in developing countries. If farmers operate efficiently, implying that profits are maximised, then incomes can only be increased by introducing improved methods of production; if farmers do not act efficiently, it may be desirable to reallocate resources within traditional agriculture. Similarly, predictions of farmers' responses to price changes and thus the impact on aggregate production and employment are based on assumptions regarding farmers' management objectives. The primary aim of this paper is to examine empirically the cropping patterns chosen by a group of peasant farmers in Surat District, India, using a simple model of risk aversion. The data show that the observed behaviour corresponds very closely to the hypothesis that farmers allocate land to different crops by striking some balance between the competing criteria of (a) increasing income and (b) decreasing risk measured by income variability. The actual definition of risk is, in this case, the mean absolute deviation of income around its mean level. Secondly, the contrasting importance of risk and credit between irrigated and unirrigated farms is illustrated, and finally, some policy implications are discussed briefly".

abstract = {Low rainfall and soils with low water holding capacity are major features of the Mallee region of south-eastern Australia. To reduce risk related to likely water deficits, many growers adopt a conservative cropping strategy based on low-input cereal crops. This approach has, however, a substantial opportunity cost by missing the potential profit from more intense cereal cropping and high yielding oilseed crops in more favourable seasons. We tested the hypothesis that whole-farm profitability could be enhanced by the adoption of a dynamic cropping strategy shifting from a cereal-only, conservative strategy in dry years, to a more risky strategy involving both cereals and canola in wet years. To test this hypothesis, we used 40-years rainfall series to (1) investigate rainfall features in 11 locations in the Mallee, (2) test the skill of simple rules to predict seasonal rainfall, as developed by local farmers, and (3) calculate whole-farm profit for conservative, risky and dynamic cropping strategies. Rainfall and profit were linked with a whole-farm model that estimates crop yield as a function of seasonal rainfall (i.e. rainfall from April to October) and water-use efficiency. Among locations, annual rainfall ranged from 259 to 358 mm. For each location, two types of seasons were defined: likely wet, when April rain was above the median, and likely dry otherwise. The strength of the association between April and seasonal rain varied widely among sites; it was stronger in locations with more marked rainfall seasonality. Contrasting whole-farm profit responses to cropping strategies were found in locations with annual rainfall below or above a threshold around 300 mm. For wetter locations (annual rain above the threshold), the more risky cropping strategy including canola was generally more profitable than the more conservative strategy. For farms in drier areas, the cereal-based conservative strategy outperformed the more risky strategy in seasons predicted to be dry, but was less profitable in wet seasons. The dynamic cropping strategy had a substantial effect on extreme years, alleviating economic losses associated with the risky strategy in dry seasons, while being able to capture the benefits of more favourable seasons. Analysis of rainfall patterns, development of a rainfall forecasting procedure, and quantification of whole-farm profit in response to cropping strategies, all highlighted the need for decision support tools that account for small-scale variation in rainfall characteristics. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.
