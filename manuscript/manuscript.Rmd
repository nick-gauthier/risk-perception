  Small-scale agriculturalists in the Mediterranean Basin rely on multiple strategies including diversification, intensification, and storage to maintain a stable food supply in the face of environmental uncertainty. Each of these strategies requires farmers to make specific resource allocation decisions in response to environmental risks and is thus sensitive to variability in both the spatiotemporal pattern of risk and the ability of farmers to perceive that pattern. In this chapter, I present an agent-based model of a Mediterranean agroecosystem. By driving the model with realistic environmental dynamics derived from simulations of mid-Holocene Mediterranean climate, and by allowing the psychology of risk perception to vary among individual farmers, I explore the hidden vulnerabilities of traditional risk-management strategies to periods of rapid climate change. I show that even when farmers are able to manage risk “optimally” in light of past experience, unanticipated changes in the spatiotemporal pattern of rainfall can still lead to major food shortfalls.

# Introduction {#intro}

Over the past 10,000 years, subsistence farmers in the Mediterranean basin have developed sophisticated strategies to maintain stable food supplies given uncertain rainfall. Their suite of strategies include practices like crop diversification, storage, and exchange [@Halstead1989]). These risk-management strategies all represent forms of \emph{regulatory feedback} used to manage complex socio-ecological systems. Regulatory feedbacks convert a system's high-variance inputs into low-variance outputs by dynamically monitoring the outputs and adjusting internal properties of the system [@Anderies2015]. Risk-managing strategies require farmers to make specific resource allocation decisions in response to environmental risks, and as regulatory feedbacks they are thus sensitive to variability in both the spatiotemporal patterns of risk and the ability of farmers to perceive and act on those patterns.

Crop diversification is an excellent example of a widespread and effective regulatory feedback strategy (Figure 1). Relying on a mix of food types with different climatic tolerances is an efficient way to maintain a robust food supply [@helmers2001separating,Anderies2006]. In the Mediterranean, land-use strategies involving a diversified portfolio of wheat and barley have been employed by even the earliest sedentary farmers, and continue to be used to this day [@GOULD1963a,Slafer1999,Abbo2009a,Marston2011190]. Wheat generally has higher yields but is sensitive to water deficits, while barley has lower yields and is drought tolerant. Planting a mix of wheat and barley, either in the same plot or in a combination of plots, is an effective means of diversifying grain supplies. By adjusting the ratio of wheat to barley, farmers can adapt to changing drought risks.

The secret to the success of earliest farmers on the mediterrenan littoral was in their manipulation of the local ecosystem to manage environmental risks. Early farmers constructed a complex agroecosystem to manage risk.
They needed to maintain stable crop yields in face of uncertain drought risks. Yield stability is very important for traditional agriculturlal commmunities not connected to larger bulk food networks (Abbo et al 2010)

Wheat/barley systems

These strategies work when risks are knonw and constant, but may be more susceptible to periods of changing climatic risks
so understanding how people of the past adapted to change is important to us today

Are these crop-diversification strategies vulnerable to the same dynamics as other social-ecological systems with similar regulatory feedbacks mechanisms? One way to address this is to model the influence of imperfect monitoring and biased decision making in uncertain environments. In this study, I accomplish this by answering two main questions:

1. How likely are droughts to occur each year in the eastern Mediterreanean, and how did these risks change over the Holocene?
2. How might Neolithic farmers have percieved these changing drought risks, and what were the consequences for farming communities with respect to their collective ability to manage risk?


I couple a climate model with high temporal resolution to a simple game theoretic model of agricultural decision making under uncertainty, in order to examine the performance of optimal and suboptimal wheat-barley diversification practices. I model the year-to-year crop diversification strategies made by farmers as an iterated game of fictitious play against nature [@GOULD1963a]. Farmers are boundedly rational, in that they seek to maximize their objective functions given the perceived probabilities of different actions by nature, but work with flawed mental models of climate-related risks due to imperfect recall of past events. Furthermore, by using a climate model to represent the actions of nature, I can more precisely capture the characteristic autocorrelated patterns of rainfall variability, rather than simply drawing rainfall values from a static distribution. This framework allows me to address the sensitivity of diversification strategies to changes and climatic variability and imperfect human perceptions of those changes.

# Decision-making in a game against nature {#sec:1}

The basic decision-making problem facing a farmer seeking to diversify their crops can be thought of as a game against nature.
We can represent this simplified decision context as a "game" in a game theorietic context (Luce raiffa 1989, milnor 1952, Agrawal1968, cassidy1971, gould 1963). The "game" in this context is the farmer's decision of which crops to plant and in what proportions, given uncertainty in the future "state-of-nature", and nature varies between several possible states such as dry and wet years (Table 1). In reality continuous, but people often intuitively solve an easier problem when faced with a complex real-world situation (cite behavioral econ or simon). The exact values in the payoff matrix here are less important than the relative payoffs in each quadrant. We can think of this game as being the culturally-inherited object. Our question is how do individuals make decisions here? So in this case the cultural norm would be to mix wheat and barley, but the learning is in the exact ratio. 

\begin{table}

\caption{Estimates of yield volume (t/ha) for ancient wheat and barley varieties derived from [@Slafer1999].}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline

 & Dry Year & Normal Year \\ \hline
Barley Yield & 0.93 & 1.18 \\ \hline
Wheat Yield & 0 & 1.60 \\ \hline

\end{tabular}
\end{table}


```{r}
wheat_dry <- 0
wheat_normal <- 1.6

barley_dry <- 0.93
barley_normal <- 1.18
```

How should an early farmer make a decision in light of this uncertainty?
The basic logic of crop diversitication is Portfolio of crops ala modern portfolio theory: Blank2001
Sometimes best to think of nature as a sentient opponent out to get you, and play strategically based on that assumption. Gould 1963,  Beckenkamp 2008
quick overview of criteria without risk, then say that a better option is to estimate the probabilities of the different state of nature
Agrawal1968 talks about the strategies in the context of agriculture being a game against nature
here I can slip in the cool thing about acting like the weather is out to get you being a good idea in states of complete uncertainty
transition -- the problem becomes easier if you have at least some idea of nature's moves, because then you cna work to get the highest yeilds given the risk of drought.

If an individual can learn about their environment, such as the risk of drought in any given year, then they can behave more rationally by trying to maximize their subjective expected utility. If the probability distribution of nature's moves is known, the farmer can choose the crop mix that simply maximizes the expected crop yields given the empirical frequency distirubtion of nature's moves. In the language of game theory, this strategy is known as a "game of ficticious play" against nature. This is an effective risk-managing strategy, but like all similar strategies that adapt to a specific pattern of variability, it is vulnerable to changes in the pattern of variability (Janssen eta al 2007)

This strategy works well when the environment is stationary -- nature plays from a fixed probability distirubtion, but is vulnerable to environmental nonstationarity. That is, when the mean or higher order moments of the rainfall distribution shift, playing a game of fictitious play can backfire because as agents get too stuck in their ways while the world changes around them. Thus it is important to understand the dynamics of risk perception -- how subjective risks, and thus subjective expected utility -- rise and fall in uncertain environments.

# Modeling perceived risks with Bayesian agents {#sec:3}

In order to manage risk, decision-makers must be perceive what exactly that risk is in the local environment. An individual's perceived risk entails more than simply the "objective" risk in the external environment [@Tucker2013]. A person's perceived risk depends in large part on their past experience, and how those experiences shape their expectations for the future. Likewise, the social responses to risk will refelct the distribution of perceived risks in a population, and by extension the collective memory of past droughts will have consequences for the population's survival and evolution.

We can capture the influences of risk perception computationally by simulating a population of "belief-based agents."
These agents develop beliefs about the risk of drought in their environment through personal experience. 
Each agent's perceived drought risks will change their subjective expected crop yields from planting different ratios of wheat to barley.

Our brains do not record every bit of perceived information in memory, rather it stores a "compact encoding" of that information which it uses for future decisions. Even if individuals aren't -- consciously or unconsciously --- making these calculations -- the basic algorithmic problem faced by the brain, and solutions it has evolved, reflect the same basic sets of constraints (Sanborn and Chater 2016).

We can efficiently simulate these population-level risk perceptions in a population of agents with Bayesian brains (Kahvalti et al 2019 ???double check). Bayesian learning allows for a minimal representation of the environment, so that each agent's beliefs can be encoded in two parameters -- defining the Beta distribution over their prior beliefs -- rather than the record of all observed years. Not only does this approach have a clear computational efficiency, but for the same reason this reflects the processes actually going on in the heads of decision makers.

```{r prior, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3, fig.cap = "Development of an individual's perceived drought risk with time, assuming a fixed drought risk of 0.5. Beliefs are represented as Beta probabiity distributions, and the increased certainty with age reflects the varying effective sample size of the Beta prior."}
prior <- function(m, n) {
  domain <- seq(0,1,0.005)
  val <- dbeta(domain, n * m, n * (1 - m))
  tibble('x' = domain, 'y' = val)
}

tibble(Age = seq(5, 50, 5),
       risk = 0.5) %>%
  mutate(belief = map2(risk, Age, ~prior(.x, .y))) %>%
  unnest(cols = c(belief)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x, y)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = Age, color = Age), size = 1.2, alpha = .8) +
  scale_color_distiller(palette = 'PuOr', guide = 'legend') +
  labs(x = expression('Drought probability (' * theta * ')'), y = 'Density') +
  theme_classic()
```

We can treat this problem elegantly using Bayesian statistics using online Bayesian learning from Bernoulli observations (Bissiri 2010). Put simply, the probability of a drought occuring in any given year is treated as a coin flip (i.e. Bernoulli distribution) with parameter $\theta$ representing the risk of drought. Uncertainty in the value of $\theta$ can be represented with a Beta distribution falling between 0 and 1. We can thus represent the exact information content of each individual agent's subjective experience of droughts using the diffusion of the prior belief (Figure \@ref(fig:prior)). What we see here is how an indiviudal's perception of the risk of drought may start off diffuse at first (here as an uniformative flat prior in which all values of theta are equally likely). As each year of experience is observed, the agent updates its beliefs accordingly, balancing the information in this year's observation with the cumulative weight of past experience. 

# Holocene drought risk in the eastern Mediterranean {#sec:2}

Estimates of drought risk in the eastern Mediterranean during the the past 10,000 years were derived from the TraCE-21k paleoclimate simulation available on the National Center for Atmospheric Research. TraCE-21K is a state-of-the-art simulation that uses a coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model (GCM) to recreate the transient response of the global climate system to changes in the Earth's orbit and greenhouse gasses over the past 22,000 years from the Last Glacial Maximum to the present [@He2011]. It generates physically consistent spatiotemporal climate dynamics, driven by current best estimates of external climate drivers (e.g. orbit, greenhouse gasses, glacial meltwater flux). The model simulates these dynamics on a six hourly timescale, and model outputs are archived at a monthly resolution.

TraCE-21k simulation outputs for the past 10,000 years were extracted from the grid cell covering the northern Levant and southeastern Turkey. This location was selected due to its proximity to archaeological sites with comparative evidence of crop diversification strategies. This region includes some of the earliest evidence of crop domestication, including sites like Jericho and Can Hasan. 

Using the climate model output, I divided each model year into dry years and wet years. A dry year was any year where less than 300mm of rain fell during the wet season (October-May), the threshold below which wheat crops will generally fail [@Wilkinson1997], and a wet/normal year was defined as any year above this threshold. Given the modeled patterns of wet and dry years, drought risk for any particular year was defined as the proportion of the previous 50 years that were dry years. Using the simulated paleoclimate, rather than modern-day weather station observations or paleoclimate proxies, allows us to estimate not just the first order statistics of the climate system (mean, variance of dry years) but also the higher order dynamics like serial autocorrelation in the perisistence of wet and dry years. This presents a much more realistic picture of the inherent year-to-year uncertainty in the climate system, and presents a challenge to simple risk-managing strategies that assume climatic risks are fixed.

Drought risks ranged from 1 in every 10 to 5 in 10 over the Holocene.

The bias-corrected wet season precipitation outputs from TraCE-21k show a relatively stationary distribution over the past 10,000 years, with slightly drier conditions during the early-mid Holocene transition at c.a. 8ka BP (Figure \@ref(fig:risk)). The utility of a diversified wheat-barley crop is immediately apparent; rainfall often fails to meet the 300mm threshold for a productive wheat crop during the entire 10,000 year span, but drops below the threshold for barley only a handful of years.

The risk of crop failure due to drought in any given year varies between 10\% and 20\%, punctuated by one to four century-long events where risk drops as low as 6\% and or exceeds 25\% (Figure \@ref(fig:risk)). Centuries of high drought risk cluster around known periods of regional and global climate deterioration, such as at 8.6ka BP and 4.2ka BP.

A simple "fixed" bayesian learner thus gets more certain with age. For young agents with weak priors, the information of each new year can strongly influence their beliefs. For older agents who have experienced many more years their priors will be stronger, and they will be less likely to update their beliefs when balancing the information from a single year with the many decades of accumulated experience. As was the case with the simple game of ficitious play above, this strategy is fine when the environment is stable and risks do not change. But when there is volatility in the environment, and risks can change, it becomes important to change your mind. Being too inflexible in one's priors can lead being too optimistic when things have really changed for the worse, and alternately being too conservative when things finally do get better. So from a Bayesian learning standpoint, how should agents choose to believe new information.


# The dynamics of risk perception {#sec:4}

What's important to remember here is that both agents are acting rationally based on their prior subjective beliefs, they only differ in those beliefs. So the conservatism of the older agent and the flexibility of the yonger agent are not wrong per se, they simply reflect differet rational approaches to the world.

So what are the consequences of these cognitive processes for early farmers in the Mediterranean?

Simulate a time series with varying drought frequency, based off the empirical drought risks derived from the paleoclimate simulation.

This suggests that people are more in danger of not realizing conditions are improving when they actually have -- the opportunity cost -- rather than failing to realize the change in the firstplace.
The law of small numbers is very important here. The range of each person's experience is so small -- every individual's perceived risk will be a small and noisy sample of the true value.
Older people are much more certain, even though they are wrong.


That is, what if the risk of a drought, theta, is not a constant but rather varies unpredictably in time?
The statistical problem shifts then to one of change detection (o'reilly 2013, gallistel et al 2014).
In other words do people simply adapt to changes -- as in the fixed bayesian learner and moving average approaches -- or do they detect them?
Strict year-to-year updating can result in overly conservative risk perceptions, suggesting people are slow to change their beliefs when in reality they often quickly update them (Bissiri 2010).
Indeed, the "forgetful bayesian brain" model seems to perform better, with a dynamic rather than fixed bayesian belief model (Zhang and Yu 2013).

That is, the above figure assumes a noise free environment with a single learner. Next we can look at a population of learners in a noisy environment

Examining the long-term dynamics of crop yields among all decision-making strategies and psychological profiles reveals variability in yields due to different decision making preferences is far greater than variability due to differences in risk perception (Figure 7). Risk-minimizing strategies sacrifice productivity for predictability, consistently lowering the mean and variance of crop yields over time. Risk-minimizing strategies are more sensitive to risk perception than yield-maximizing strategies; varying the memory decay rate parameter $\lambda$ had no effect on the optimal crop allocation for yield maximizers. 
^^ change above to talk about individual uncertainty in drought risk is often greater than the actual variability in drought risk, given the limited life experience an individual draws from

During periods of climatic stability, allowing past experiences to influence decision making helps farmers minimize the impacts of \emph{predictable} drought. But past experiences are less informative during periods of rapid climate change, and even farmers who manage risk “optimally” experience major food shortfalls. Climatically-induced variability in food supplies consistently surpasses that from differences in risk-perception psychology, but not that from different risk aversion preferences. This finding suggests that the efficacy of risk managing strategies that rely on regulatory feedbacks is limited to periods of relative climatic stability. This is consistent with the observation from the Roman Period Mediterranean that while minor food crises were common in the ancient world, extreme famines were rare [@Garnsey1989].

These two plots begin to look more alike the more you sample, which makes sense because its an ergodic system.

Note in these plots above and below we're summing all the wheat and barley in the population, compared to below which shows the wheat proportions of individuals.


# Conclusion

Given the average drought risks estimated from TraCE-21k and assuming perfect monitoring and recall of recent droughts (i.e. $\lambda = 0$), farmers intent on minimizing the risk of crop failure would be expected to plant about 65\% barley to 35\% wheat on average. This proportion is within the range estimated from macrobotanical remains at a nearby archaeological site [@Marston2011190]. Yield maximizing farmers instead play a pure strategy profile, planting wheat if the perceived drought risk is less than 0.68 and barley if it is more. Because the GCM-simulated drought risk never rises above this threshold, a yield-maximizing farmer will always plant a wheat monocrop.




Statistically downscaling palaeoclimate simulations and coupling them to game theoretic models of decision making under uncertainty is a simple way to better understand the patterning of climate changes and the regulatory feedbacks farmers use to adapt to them. To further explore these patterns, future work should incorporate additional risk-minimizing strategies such as storage and exchange. Food storage and exchange can also be thought of as forms of diversification, the former in the time and the latter in space [@Marston2011190]. Food exchange would be of particular interest from a game theoretic perspective, as incomplete information with respect to an exchange partner's crop diversification and storage practices can lead to situations of moral hazard.


Think about the importance of the population's age structure, becuase that's going to impact the collective memory of drought.
